# JPN-Sentence-API
 API to fetch example sentences from a gigantic list
 
 Currently work in progress, but idea is to be able to search for any key-word and recieve an example sentence containing the key-word.  The plan is to use this in conjunction with JPN-Web-Dictionary to implement example sentence features with a custom API.
